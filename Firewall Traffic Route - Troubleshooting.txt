SPlunk will listen 514 only on root user

For non-root user splunk will not listen below 1024 ports

we can route the 514 traffic to 5154

In HF we can set the stanza accordingly

Check whether the splunk is connected with port 5154
netstat -anp | grep 514

cd /opt/splunk/etc/system/local

[udp://5154]
connection_host = ip
